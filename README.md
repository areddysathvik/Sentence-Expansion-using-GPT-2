# Sentence Expansion using GPT-2

![GPT-2 Sentence Expansion](https://i.gifer.com/Owf9.gif)

Welcome to the **Sentence Expansion using GPT-2** GitHub repository! This project showcases my work on sentence expansion using the GPT-2 model, which I developed as part of my project. Sentence expansion involves taking an incomplete sentence and generating a coherent continuation to make it more detailed and informative.

## Example

**Prompt:** Once upon a time

**Continuation by Model:** A man was having a dream he said he saw a man in a yellow robe walking toward him in a straight line he said the man was a man of many faces the man walked with a straight back and wore no shoes the man was tall and thin and wore a flowing black robe with a gold and red brooch at the breast the robe had a subtle resemblance to that of the duke leto of arrakis the robe was a symbol of power the man said and he gestured to a guard of some of the people ahead of him the man turned and walked on ahead of them the man in the yellow robe stopped in front of the duke the duke looked up at the man in the yellow robe
